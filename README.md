Day 34: Unlocking the Power of AOP in Spring!
Today I dove into Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and it’s a game-changer:
1) Learned how AOP tackles cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.
2) Explored use cases where AOP shines.
3) Set up an AOP project from scratch.
4) Created @Before advice to intercept method calls.
5) Tested it with AccountDAO – and it worked like magic!. <br>

Day 35: Mastering AOP Pointcuts Like a Pro!
Today I leveled up my AOP skills with surgical precision:
1) Pointcut Expressions
 -Learned the "where" of AOP - telling advice exactly where to execute
 -Created razor-sharp method matching with expressions
2) Coded a Real Example
 -Targeted all addAccount() methods flawlessly
 -Made my aspect work only where needed - no more, no less <br>

 Day 36: Becoming a Pointcut Ninja in Spring AOP!
Today I leveled up my AOP game with precision pointcuts:
1) Learned to target with surgical precision
 -Matched specific DAO methods (AccountDAO.addAccount())
 -Captured all add* wildcard methods
 -Scoped by return types and parameters
2) Hands-on coding wins
 -Nailed package-level matching
 -Mastered parameter type patterns (even Account+more params)
